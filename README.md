# Grokking DLT Kafka

How can dlt be used to design a micro batch etl pipeline to move data from Kafka into any of dlt's supported destination systems? That's the question I am looking to answer with this experiment.

The goal is to see what dlt supports out of the box with it's Kafka integration and then set baseline requirements for what I want to be able to do while leveraging dlt.
